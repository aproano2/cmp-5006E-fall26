"""Break #1 -- reused_pad : "one-time" pad used for every message (n-time pad).

Assumption broken: "a pad is unbreakable" -- but only if each pad byte is used ONCE.
Here the same 200-byte pad encrypts all four messages, so  C_i xor C_j = P_i xor P_j
and the key cancels out.

Method (crib-dragging, ciphertext only -- we never touch _PAD_KEY or the plaintexts
in the source file):
  Round 0  If two ciphertexts start with the same bytes, their plaintexts do too.
  Round 1+ XOR a guessed word (a "crib") into one message at some offset. That yields
           the pad bytes at those offsets. Decrypt the OTHER messages with those pad
           bytes: if they turn into English, the crib was right. Extend and repeat.
  Check    The TARGET (msg3) is never used as a crib source after round 0: its text
           comes out by decrypting with a pad recovered from msg0, msg1 and msg2.

Run:  python3 break1_reused_pad.py
