"""Break #2 -- ecb_store : customer records encrypted block-by-block (ECB).

Assumption broken: "if I can't decrypt it, it leaks nothing" -- but ECB is a
deterministic map per block, so EQUAL plaintext blocks give EQUAL ciphertext blocks
and the pattern of equalities is visible without the key.

Method: split every ciphertext into 4-byte blocks (8 hex chars), find which blocks
repeat across records, and read the structure. We never use the key.

Run:  python3 break2_ecb.py
