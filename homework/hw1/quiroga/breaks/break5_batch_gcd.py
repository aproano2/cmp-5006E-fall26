"""Break #5 -- keygen_fleet : RSA keys from a low-entropy device fleet (shared prime).

Assumption broken: "a 2^64-ish random prime is never repeated" -- true only if the random
source has enough entropy at key-generation time. Devices booting with the same weak PRNG
state produced the same prime p, so  gcd(n_i, n_j) = p  and factoring is trivial, even
though factoring a 128-bit n from scratch is the thing RSA relies on being hard.

Method: batch-GCD over the public moduli. For each n_i compute
        g_i = gcd( n_i , (P mod n_i^2) / n_i )     where P = product of all moduli.
g_i > 1 and g_i != n_i  <=> n_i shares a prime with another modulus (this is the simple
version of Bernstein's product-tree algorithm, fine for 4 keys; a product/remainder tree
makes it quasi-linear for millions of keys, as in the 2012 "Mining your Ps and Qs" scan).
Then rebuild the private exponent d and PROVE it works.

Run:  python3 break5_batch_gcd.py
